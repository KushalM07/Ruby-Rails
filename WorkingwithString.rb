# here we will learn about Variables i.e. how to get store data in a variable just like Var,const in js and etc

# Syntax to create a variable

# name_of_the_variable = "value in variable "
#  we can reassign the value

name  = 'John'
age = 20
name = 'Kushal'
istrue = false
points  = 2.3
flaws = nil
# this flaws variable doesn't have any value


puts name
puts name.upcase()
puts name.downcase()
puts name.strip()
puts name.length()
puts name.index('shal')
puts name[0]
puts name[0,3]
# 3 index is not included
puts name.include? "shal"
puts ("Once upon a time there was a man name " +  name)
