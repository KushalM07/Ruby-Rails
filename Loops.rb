# mainly we will learn about While loop and For Loop



# Syntax of While Loop
# index= 1
# while condition
# exp...
# end



index = 1
while index <= 8
puts index
index +=1
end




# Syntax of For Loop
friends = ['Kevin' , 'Karen','Oscar',28]

# friends.each do |friend|
#   puts friend

# end



# For loop simple from 0 to 5
#for index in 0..5
#   puts index
# end


# for friend in friends
# puts friend
# end


# 6.times do |index|
#   puts index
# end




#comments methods

# first by adding '#' this symbol for single line comment
=begin
  Second by this method where we have to write the =begin and end where it ends for multiline code
end
